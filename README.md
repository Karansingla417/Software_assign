1. File System Structure:
The file system is conceptualized as a tree-like structure, where each node represents either a directory or a file.
The primary data structure is the Node class, which encapsulates attributes such as the node's name, type (file or directory), content (for files), and children (subdirectories or files).
2. Command Classes:
Each file system operation is encapsulated within a dedicated command class (e.g., CdCommand, LsCommand, EchoCommand, etc.).
Command classes provide a static execute method, accepting the file system (fs) and necessary arguments for the operation.
3. Command Execution in Main Loop:
The main loop in main.py reads user input, parses the command, and subsequently executes the corresponding command class. A dictionary is employed to map command names to their respective classes.
The input undergoes tokenization to facilitate command and argument parsing. This implementation is designed to support basic input handling and argument splitting.
4. Path Handling:
Path handling is integral to many commands. Internally, the _parse_path method is employed to extract the target node and name from a given path.
5. Design Decisions:
The choice of a tree-like structure for the file system facilitates the easy representation of directories, subdirectories, and files.
Commands are implemented as separate classes to adhere to object-oriented design principles, ensuring modularity and extensibility.
The use of a dictionary for children in the Node class facilitates efficient lookup of child nodes by name.
6. Error Handling:
Error messages are systematically provided for scenarios where a specified path or operation is not found or is invalid.
Specific error messages are printed for common issues, such as attempting to move a non-existent source or moving to a non-existent directory.
Usage:
Running the Program:

Execute main.py to initiate the file system simulation.
Available Commands:

mkdir: Create directories
cd: Change directory
ls: List contents of a directory
grep: Search for a pattern in a file
cat: Display the contents of a file
touch: Create files
echo: Write content to a file
mv: Move or rename files and directories
cp: Copy files and directories
rm: Remove files and directories
Exiting the Program:

Terminate the program by pressing Ctrl+C.
Conclusion:
This file system simulation not only serves as an educational tool for comprehending fundamental file system operations but also showcases the application of object-oriented principles and modularity in designing a command-line interface for file manipulation. The use of a tree structure and distinct command classes ensures the system's scalability and flexibility, allowing for easy expansion and enhancement of file system functionality.
